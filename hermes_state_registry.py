"""Process-wide shared SessionDB registry (#90837).

A gateway process opens state.db from many call sites — the runner's
``AsyncSessionDB``, the ``SessionStore`` per-path cache, per-agent lazy
recall (``run_agent._get_session_db_for_recall``), per-job cron opens,
and per-message opens in mirror / channel_directory / slash_commands /
shutdown_flush / session_search / react_to_message.  Each bare
``SessionDB()`` mints its own writer connection, ``self._lock``,
close-time WAL checkpoint, and async token-writer thread.  With N
independent writer connections on one WAL file, mutual exclusion relies
only on SQLite's WAL write lock plus each instance's busy_timeout retry
ladder — and one connection's close-time checkpoint can race another's
growth, producing the lost/reordered-page-write signature reported
across 11+ incidents (#90837).

This module owns that boundary: one shared ``SessionDB`` per resolved
path per process, refcounted, with generation-aware retirement when the
underlying file is replaced (snapshot restore, recovery swap).

Lifecycle rules:

- ``acquire(path)`` returns the current generation for *path*,
  incrementing its refcount.  Same path ⇒ same instance ⇒ same writer
  connection.
- ``close()`` on a shared instance is a NO-OP.  The registry — not any
  individual caller — owns the connection lifecycle, so one caller's
  ``close()`` can never tear down a writer other callers still hold.
- ``release(db)`` decrements the generation *db was acquired from*
  (object-keyed, not pathname-keyed, so an inode replacement cannot
  strand a still-owned generation).  The final release of a retired
  generation tears it down.
- On inode change, the old generation is RETIRED — never lent again —
  but stays alive until its existing holders release.  If a replacement
  open fails, the registry is left WITHOUT a path entry (never a closed
  stale object), so the next acquire retries fresh.
- All teardown happens OUTSIDE the registry lock: a final release's
  WAL checkpoint must never stall acquisition for every state.db.
